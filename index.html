                    <p>
                        I have a strong passion for learning new technologies and believe in the power of clean and efficient code.
                        But let's not forget the most important ingredient: hard work!
                        When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me hanging out with my favorite TV show characters-yes, I'm talking
                        about the Friends series!
                        I never miss an opportunity to catch up with Ross, Rachel, and the gang.
                        And let's not forget about my other love-coffee!
                        I believe it's the fuel that keeps the code flowing and the ideas brewing.

                            The information is saved in "localStorage".
                            Each user can issue an expense report by year and month.

                            It offers a simple and engaging experience for players. The codebase is organized into different modules, enhancing modularity and readability. It follows the traditional approach, where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The implementation includes player management, game flow, and checking for a winning condition. It provides a solid foundation for understanding the game's mechanics and can serve as a starting point for further enhancements or customizations.
