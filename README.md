# Karin Ochayon's Website

## About Me
Hi! I'm Karin Ochayon, a Junior Software Developer/Internship Position seeker, and I'm here to add a little bit of fun to your day. I have a strong passion for learning new technologies and believe in the power of clean and efficient code. But let's not forget the most important ingredient: hard work!

When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me hanging out with my favorite TV show characters—yes, I'm talking about the Friends series! I never miss an opportunity to catch up with Ross, Rachel, and the gang. And let's not forget about my other love—coffee! I believe it's the fuel that keeps the code flowing and the ideas brewing.

## About the Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal website, where you can learn more about me, my projects, and my skills. The website is designed to showcase my portfolio, share my experiences, and connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community.

With a clean and user-friendly interface, the website reflects my personality and professional aspirations. It incorporates modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and interactive experience.
